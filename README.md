# Code Quiz

  ## Description

  This is a short and simple multiple choice quiz game, where the user is scored based on correct answers, and speed. It locally stores user scores to display a high-score list.  Dynamically generated HTML using Bulma for styling makes up the visual portion of the app, with javascript for the logic portion.
